# bootstrap-boilerplate

This is a practice repository for my Mobile Friendly Website class at [Bitwise Industries](https://bitwiseindustries.com/).


## Description

Create a responsive html/css website that contains the following requirements:

- Readability of Code
- Proper File/Directory structure
- Everything is linked correctly (i.e. CDNs, local files, meta tags, link tags, etc.)
- Bootstrap is properly implemented (Grid, Components, etc)
- The site is responsive across multiple screen sizes
- Media queries are properly implemented


## Design

The design of this responsive html/css website should include the following requirements:

+ Nav/Navbar
+ Carousel
+ Accordion or thumbnails
+ Self-written content / No lorem ipsum!
+ Must include a link to at least 1 site you've created
+ Use at least 4 social media / font awesome icons
+ Use at least 2 Google Fonts
+ Customized Contact Form


## Development 

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it is free but powerful. If you are an experienced web developer, then use any IDE of your choice. If you are an old school web developer, Notepad or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) will be sufficient.
